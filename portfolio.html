    <h6></h6><p>Hello my name is Shourya Pattabhi. I live in Dublin, California. I have a lot of interests but they mainly focused on playing poker, investing in the stock market, coding, and playing tennis. Through this hobbies, I set myself a career goal that i would want to become a trader at a bank or become a portfolio manager at a Hedge fund. Through this process, I aspire to earn an masteres degree in either Computer Science or Financial Statistics. My main goal for myself regarding my education is to go to a good college that offers excellent programs in both Economics and Computer Science. I enjoy both of these fields of studies and I hope to study it more in depth as I become older. My dream college would be UC Berkeley or NYU. I have also learned that Computer Science is essential to these fields as coding is heavily used to trade equities along with crude oil contracts. This allowed me to learn Computer Science in the lense of a financial trader. I aspire to reach my goals by taking advanced classes in math and computer science throughout my high school career. I am geniuenly interested in trading stock options and crude oil contracts as it represents what is going on in the world. It represents the world in a meritocracy view which in my eyes is the true way.  </p>

At this investment bank, I hope to trade a financial product called Equity Derivatives which I find extremely interesting to say the least. I hope I can build my career from here and become good enough to set up my own hedge fund where I would be trading this same financial product. This would be considered as one of my main goals. There are still many years ahead of me and I am keen to see what fortune seeks for me. </p>
